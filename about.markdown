The name Frog Teeth came from my daughter. One day we were coloring and she had drawn a frog and I asked what part she was coloring and she said "the teeth!"

So of course I hit Wikipedia and yep, frogs have teeth, but they're more for holding food in place while swallowing and to get a good grip rather than for chewing and cutting.

I stored that in the back of my brain for a few months and when I was thinking about making this site I thought about what kind of stuff I wanted to talk about. The stuff that is interesting to me is the more practical and convenient rather than the black and stealthy. A small Alox Cadet Swiss Army Knife makes more sense to me than a Benchmade Griptilian.

The Griptilian is a great knife! I think it looks cool and if I had to cut stuff all day I'd probably want to carry one. But I cut things about once a day; boxes, packaging, and strings, that sort of thing. The Griptilian could do it easy, but the Cadet also has a bottle opener and a screwdriver you can use in a pinchâ€”I need those more.
