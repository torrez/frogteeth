I started carrying an Alox Cadet by accident. I originally thought I wanted a single-blade folding knife so I bought a CRKT and carried it around a bit, but I realized I wanted to have something with some options in my backpack. 

So I bought what I thought was the simplest Swiss Army Knife (SAK) that seemed more durable than the typical cellulose handled knives and slipped it into a pocket in my bag.

When I realized I needed more options in my EDC I rotated out the CRKT with the Cadet, and planned to eventually get something with even more tools soon after.

That was two years ago and I don't think I'm ever going to get that next knife.

The Alox Cadet is # inches long (# centimeters), contains # tools, and, unlike most SAKs, is clad in aluminum.
