I started carrying an [Alox Cadet](http://amzn.to/2iyeyrS) by accident. I originally thought I wanted a single-blade folding knife so I bought a CRKT and carried it around a bit. Around the same time I decided I wanted to have a knife with some options in my backpack for times when I'd be traveling and needed a different tool.

I bought what I thought was the simplest Swiss Army Knife (SAK) that seemed more durable than the typical cellulose handled knives and slipped it into a pocket in my bag for later.

At some point I decided I probably needed a knife with more tools in my pocket every day so I swapped the SAK in my bag for the CRKT, thinking I'd get one with more tools at some point.

That was two years ago and I don't think I'm ever going to get that next knife. I love my Alox Cadet.

The Cadet is 5.75 inches long (~14.6 centimeters), contains 8 tools on four folding parts, and unlike most SAKs, it's clad in an aluminum handle.

The 8 tools are on four metal parts: a 2.5 inch (6.35 centimeters) blade; a nail file and nail cleaner; bottle opener, wire stripper, flat-head screwdriver; and a can opener, tiny flat-head screwdriver.

I've used all of these at some point except the nail file--that always seemed odd to me.

The nicest thing I can say about this knife is that I forget I'm carrying it until I need it. It's thinner than most SAKs due to the aluminum handle, which also means it can go into the same pocket as my Keysmart key-holder. They're roughly the same size and both seem to have the same hardness so that neither one does any visible damage to the other.

The second thing I'd say is that the knife is, for my needs, exactly the size I need.

When I started carrying the CRKT it always seemed to be in the way when I sat down. I'd take it out and set it down on my desk, occasionally forgetting it when I left work. A few times I'd need a bottle opener or a screwdriver and wish it had one.

When I started carrying the Cadet it covered all my needs. And given my very small cutting needs the tiny blade was fine. I do miss the CRKTs serrated edge, which made quick work of a large bush's trunk once, but otherwise it's the perfect size for me.
